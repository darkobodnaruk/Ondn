This program takes Google Analytics Pages report file and returns the selected number of articles with the most pageviews in another file that the user specifies.

It is intended for separating the most viewed article pages from section pages in GA reports of a certain news website, since section pages are usually at the top of the report.

So it might be useful to editors and journalists to a certain extent, but it will probably demand some modification on their part.

!!!IMPORTANT - The original file must be in .csv format and must be exported from the Pages section.

The number of rows the original file must have depends on the number of articles the user wishes to have in the cleansed report. In general; the higher, the better.

Recommended format for target files are .txt and .csv
